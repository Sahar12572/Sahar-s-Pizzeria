        At Sahar's Pizzeria & Pasta House, our journey started with a simple
        love for great food and family traditions. Inspired by generations of
        homemade recipes, we set out to create a place where everyone feels at
        home. From our very first pizza to the rich, comforting pasta dishes we
        serve today, our passion for quality and flavor has never changed. Every
        meal we make is a tribute to the warmth of family gatherings, laughter
        around the table, and the joy of sharing delicious food.

        We believe that great food starts with great ingredients. Our
        hand-stretched pizzas are made with the finest dough, slow-risen for the
        perfect crisp and chew. We top them with rich tomato sauce, creamy
        mozzarella, and the freshest toppings. Our pasta is made with love,
        featuring house-made sauces simmered to perfection. Whether you’re
        craving a classic Margherita pizza, a hearty plate of fettuccine
        Alfredo, or a bold, spicy arrabbiata, every dish is crafted to deliver a
        taste of true Italian comfort.
